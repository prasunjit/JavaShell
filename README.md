# JavaShell
Mini Java Shell (Bash) to execute the commands specified by the user.Like any other shell, closh takes as input the name of the program to run (e.g., hostname, pwd, echo, etc.). However, closh also takes three additional inputs:  The number of copies (processes) of the program to run. This is an integer from 1 to 9. Whether the processes should execute concurrently or sequentially. Optionally, a timeout (also an integer from 1 to 9) specifying the maximum duration of each process in seconds (reset between processes if running sequentially). If a process takes longer than the timeout, it is terminated. A timeout value of zero specifies no timeout.
